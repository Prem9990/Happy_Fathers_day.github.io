You carried me in your arms when I was little and held my hand while I was growing up.
Papa, I am going to be your pillar when you are old and I will carry you in my heart until I die.
Thanks for everything. Happy Father’s Day!
Papa's are most ordinary men turned by love into heroes.
Anyone can be a Father, but it takes someone special to be a Father, and 
that’s why I call you Papa because you are so special to me. You taught me the game of life and you only taught me 
how to play it right.
My mother gave me my birth, but my father gave me my dreams. Thanks to you papa.
Happy Father’s Day!
